/// The interface that the lifecycle manager expects its contributing realtime channels to conform to.
///
/// We use this instead of the ``RealtimeChannelProtocol`` interface as:
///
/// - its ``attach`` and ``detach`` methods are `async` instead of using callbacks
/// - it uses `AsyncSequence` to emit state changes instead of using callbacks
///
/// This makes it easier to write mocks for (since ``RealtimeChannelProtocol`` doesn’t express to the type system that the callbacks it receives need to be `Sendable`, it’s hard to, for example, create a mock that creates a `Task` and then calls the callback from inside this task).
///
/// We choose to also mark the channel’s mutable state as `async`. This is a way of highlighting at the call site of accessing this state that, since `ARTRealtimeChannel` mutates this state on a separate thread, it’s possible for this state to have changed since the last time you checked it, or since the last time you performed an operation that might have mutated it, or since the last time you recieved an event informing you that it changed. To be clear, marking these as `async` doesn’t _solve_ these issues; it just makes them a bit more visible. We’ll decide how to address them in https://github.com/ably-labs/ably-chat-swift/issues/49.
